The selector can also be used to Cancel or Delete games.

**Captions**

| Text/Image | Type | Comments |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Start | Static |   |
| Home Team | Static |   |
| Away Team | Static |   |

**Inputs**

| Name | Type | Constraints |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Start | Date Selector |  Any valid date |
| Home Team | Drop Down selector | Drop down list of all teams associated with the selected sport and league. |
| Away Team | Drop Down selector | Drop down list of all teams associated with the selected sport and league. |

**Actions**

| Caption | Type | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ADD +  | Button | Add the game to the list of created games. |

**Validation**

| **Exception** | Error Message |
| :--- | :--- |
| No start time | Start time not entered |
| Home Team | No home team selected |
| Away Team | No away team selected |
| Home Team and Away Team must be different | Teams must be different |

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note**: There is no validation to stop the same game from being created twice. The reason for this is because it's common in certain sports to have 'double-headers' where two teams play each other more than once in a day.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note**: There is no validation to stop a game start time from being in the passed. This is because game start times do change and it maybe necessary to start a game in the selector that has already started in real time.
{% endhint %}

Each new game will have its status set to `Not Started`

A [`create`](../../api/bos-schema.md#create) incident will be pushed to the BOS instances.

## Start Game

To start a game click on the `Start` button next to the game. The game status will then change to `In Progress`

**Actions**

| Caption | Type | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Start`  | Button | Start the selected game. |

An [`in_progress`](../../api/bos-schema.md#in_progress) incident will be pushed to the BOS instances with the `whistle_start_time` set to the time when the `Start` button was clicked.

## Finish Game

To finish a game enter the score for both home and away teams and click on the `Finish` button next to the game. The game status will then change to `Finished`

**Inputs**

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left">Name</th>
      <th style="text-align:left">Type</th>
      <th style="text-align:left">Constraints</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">Home Score</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">Text Box</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">Numeric, max 999</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>Away</p>
        <p>Score</p>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">Text Box</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">Numeric, max 999</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>**Actions**

| Caption | Type | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Finish`  | Button | Finish the selected game and record the score. |

A [`result`](../../api/bos-schema.md#result) incident followed by a [`finish`](../../api/bos-schema.md#finish) incident will be pushed to the BOS instances with the `whistle_end_time` set to the time when the Finish button was clicked, and the result to the home score and away score values.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note: It's not possible to corrects scores and re-send them to BOS. For this reason the `finish` incident is sent immediately after the `result` incident as a result of just clicking on the `Finish` button.
{% endhint %}

## Cancel Game

Any game can be cancelled as long as it's either `Not Started` or `In Progress.`

To cancel a game click on the `Cancel` text next to the game. 

A confirmation message will be shown. 

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-03-09-at-4.37.27-pm.png)

Click on `Yes` to cancel the game \(game status will then change to `Canceled)` or `No` to to return without canceling.

A `canceled` incident will be sent to BOS.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tip**: for the purposes of BOS incidents 'canceled' can also be interpreted as postponed but not as delayed. A delayed game is expected to restart. But once a game has been canceled it can't be restarted. If a game is canceled and then played the following day it would have to re-created with the new start time.
{% endhint %}

## Delete Game

A game can only be deleted if it hasn't been started \(has a status of `Not Started`\).

To delete a game click on the Delete text next to the game. 

A confirmation message will be shown. 

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-03-09-at-4.37.40-pm.png)

Click on `Yes` to delete the game \(game will be removed\) or `No` to to return without deleting.

If a game is deleted than a `canceled` incident must also be sent to BOS so that BOS can tag the game in the same way as a canceled game.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note**: The difference between a canceled game and a deleted game is that a deleted game is basically a game that was entered in error and once deleted is removed from the database so it can be re-entered correctly if needed. A canceled game is a proper game that for one reason or other doesn't take place after being created correctly.
{% endhint %}

## Selector Grid

The selector grid is where all games are recorded as they get entered and moved through the workflow.

The selector grid is made up as follows:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left">Column</th>
      <th style="text-align:left">Type</th>
      <th style="text-align:left">Description</th>
