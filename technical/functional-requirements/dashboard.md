# Dashboard

The dashboard is the main screen and is opened from the [Home Page](home-page.md) as soon as the user is logged in.

The components of the dashboard are:

## Header

The dashboard header is shown at the top of the screen and is non-scrollable. That is to say that if the application is run on a small display such that the user has to scroll up and down to see all of the dashboard, the header is always 'pinned' at the top of the screen.

## Sports Tabs

The sports tab runs horizontally across the dashboard and displays one tab for each sport that is enabled. The tabs are dynamic and configured through the MySql database [`Sports`](../../database/objects/tables.md#sports) table. 

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-03-02-at-4.06.40-pm%20%281%29.png)

The order the sports tabs are displayed in is defined by their `id` value in the [`Sports`](../../database/objects/tables.md#sports)  table.

There is no limit on the number of sports tabs that can be created. If the tabs reach the horizontal limit of the application then they will stack in to multiple rows. Realistically there should never be so many sports enabled at any one time to cause the tabs to be stacked.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Important**: The sports tabs must be 100% configurable through the database only. Sports must be added or removed without any code changes.
{% endhint %}

Clicking on any unselected tab will:

1. Update the Leagues Tabs to show only the leagues associated with the selected sport.
2. Change the calendar display to show only events for the selected sport and league.

By default, when a new sports tab is selected the league will default to the first one in the list.

## Leagues Tab

The leagues tab runs vertically down the left side of the dashboard and displays one tab for each league that is configured for the selected sport. The tabs are dynamic and configured through the MySql database [`Leagues`](../../database/objects/tables.md#leagues) table. 

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-03-02-at-4.06.55-pm.png)

The order the leagues tabs are displayed in is defined by their `id` value in the [`Leagues`](../../database/objects/tables.md#leagues) table.

There is no limit on the number of sports tabs that can be created. If the tabs reach the vertical limit of the application then they will stack in to multiple columns. Realistically there should never be so many leagues enabled at any one time to cause the tabs to be stacked.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Important**: The leagues tabs must be 100% configurable through the database only. Leagues must be added or removed without any code changes.
{% endhint %}

Clicking on any unselected tab will change the calendar display to show only events for the selected sport and league.

## Calendar

The calendar component is the main 'engine' of the application. It's here that the user will navigate through, enter and select new games.
