# Calendar

The calendar component is the main 'engine' of the application. It's here that the user will navigate through, enter and select new games.

The calendar will dynamically create a month plan for each month selected using the forward \(&gt;\) and backward \(&lt;\) selectors. There will be no upper or lower limits for the first release.

Every time the calendar changes from December -&gt; January or January &lt;- December the year will change accordingly.

The numbers of days will be adjusted for each month and take into account leap years.

Weekdays will be displayed as Sunday -&gt; Saturday.

The current day should be a different colour and larger than the other days.

Moving the cursor over any day cell will highlight it.

#### League Crest

If a day has at least one game scheduled then the crest for the league associated with the current calendar will be shown in that day cell.

#### Game Counter

If a day has at least one game scheduled then a badge for the total number of games will be shown in that day cell.
