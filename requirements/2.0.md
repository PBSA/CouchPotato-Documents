* Rewards
  * Each user can be given points/rewards/NFTs-beloging-to-the-team depending up on whether she was the first to enter data, whether she was validated by largest number of other users etc.
  * Users entering start and stop with & scores will be considered for higher/larger-chunk of rewards.
  * Users entering just the score will get equal reward as that of the user validating.
* One source entering the data \[data feed model\] & then multiple others verifying & everyone has equal weight of verification
* multiple sources \(users\) and multiple verification with each user with different weights
* Storage of each source's data in an immutable manner on the blockchain but without adding junk to the chain
* Blockchain storage preferably in a RocksDB for longer storage
* * Validation Weight: The validation weight can be based on the GPOS stake ?
* Each person validating and getting validating can get points based on the validations received.
* the validation points weight can be calculated from the person's GPOS weight at first
* As we progress, validation-weight can be GPOS-weightage+past-points-earned-via-CP
* Weight/POWER can also be based on social verfications - Peerplays verfication \(must\), Telegram, Facebook, Discord, Google = optional ... \(This will be similar to what keybase does and creates web-of-trust\)
